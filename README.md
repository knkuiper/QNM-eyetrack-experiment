# QNM-eyetrack-experiment
 
This is a setup to do an eye tracking experiment for the couse MQNM at UU. The experiment involves letting participants watch a film scene in two parts (either including subtitles or not).

It also includes an R script for analyzing data and making heatmaps from the eye tracking data gathered from the experiment.
